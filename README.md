SQL analysis of weather data


## **Overview**
The goal is to utilize SQLAlchemy to analyze a data table focused on a variety of weather statistics in Hawaii. Ultimately the question the challenge is trying to resolve is
whether a surf and ice cream shop business will thrive and be profitable year-round on Oahu? The current focus is on determining whether Oahu is temperate enough in June and December.
However, even after ascertaining these facts there exists other opportunities to explore in order to answer if this is the best residence for a surf and ice-cream shop. 


### **Results**: 

* **What is the temperature like in Oahu in June and December?**
Enclosed is side-by-side comparison of June and December temperatures and varying statistics, respectively from years 2010-2017. As one can see there is ample evidence that the average temperature for Oahu 
is temperate year-round, with very little variation not only between averages but across minimum and maximum temperatures recorded between the respective months. 

![Exhibit A](https://github.com/ljlodl5/surfs_up/blob/main/JuneDecTemps%20Combined.png)



* **There is an ~11% difference in temperature counts captured**
While there are numerous temperatures to draw June and December averages between years 2010-2017, there exists an 11% difference in the counts captured for June (1700) and December (1517). 
Are there less stations, what is impacting the reduction in numbers and does this have a real impact on how temperate December really is?  


* **The standard deviation is elevated for December**
While the standard deviation is not extremely different between June (3.2) and December (3.7) the difference can mean there are outliers to consider in December.
Outlier temperatures can have a real impact on the amount of customers at the surf and ice cream shop. 
It may be a good opportunity to have Plan B offerings in December to ensure labor matches demand.

## **Summary**
In conclusion, it is clear that Oahu is temperate in June and December. Strictly speaking from temperature alone there should be demand year round for both surf and ice cream. 
However, it is important to do additional research when considering such an investment. 
1) It would also be prudent to review the precipitation for Oahu as well including months outside of June and December. While cold temperatures will keep individuals away, so will rain.
   It is important to remain realistic in the demand for the business in rain as well as cool weather. 
2) While not included within this database I would want to view how other ventures of similar vision manage in similar climates? Do businesses of this nature do well in other places?

Oahu is definitely a place to consider, but it is important to note other statistics and locations should be considered as well.
